it for the commit part

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==git checkout

THEN TYPE GIT STATUS TO CHECK THE STATUS 
AND IT TELLS U ABOUT THE CHANGE MADE IN DFF FILES AND THEN MAKE A COMMIT TO ADD INTO THE LOGS 
FILES ARE ALREDY ADDED YOU DIRECTLY NEED TO MAKE A COMMIT

even on deleting the files the commit related to that file is still present and hence tou cn revert back 
and get tht file again into the repository
